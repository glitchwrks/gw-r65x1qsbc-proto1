R65X1Q Prototyping Board
========================

This project is a prototyping board for the [Glitch Works R65X1Q Single Board Computer](https://www.tindie.com/products/21523/). It provides a pad-per-hole board with dedicated areas for the Glitchbus, `PORT B`, and `PORT D` connectors on the SBC. All signal pins are labeled on front and back.

Aside from being a useful prototyping board, this project can be used as the starting point for a custom expansion PCB for the R65X1Q SBC.

Note that if you're not using the `PORT B` and/or `PORT D` features of the SBC, you're likely better off using a standard Glitchbus prototyping board, since other computers will be compatible with it.
